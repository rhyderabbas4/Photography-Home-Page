# Photography-Home-Page
This project is a CSS-based sidebar menu for a photography site. It features a full-screen background, a sliding sidebar with a logo, nav links, and social icons. Built with only HTML and CSS, it includes smooth transitions, custom fonts, and hover effects for a clean, modern look.
